I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Biochemistry at Western University, Canada. My research focuses on developing artificial intelligence methods for drug discovery, particularly in molecular property prediction, drugâ€“target interaction modeling, and geometric deep learning.

I obtained my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Manitoba, where I was supervised by [Prof. Pingzhao Hu](https://phulab.org/). Before pursuing my doctoral studies, I worked at GE Healthcare, engaging in research and development related to biomedical data analysis and AI-driven healthcare solutions.
