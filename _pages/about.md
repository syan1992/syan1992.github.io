I am currently a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Biochemistry at Western University, Canada. My research focuses on developing artificial intelligence methods for drug discovery, particularly in molecular property prediction, drug–target interaction modeling, and geometric deep learning.

I obtained my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Manitoba, where I was **co-supervised by** [Prof. Pingzhao Hu](https://phulab.org/) and **Prof. Carson K. Leung**. Prior to my doctoral studies, I worked at GE Healthcare, contributing to research and development in biomedical data analysis and AI-driven healthcare solutions.
